### Chief Editor
DR.Thavamaran is currently working in the area of access networks, with particular interest in convergence between fixed and mobile networks.
In the attempt to realize the dream of convergence, he leads a group of experts in the area of radio-over-fibre (RoF) to develop a multiservice centralized network that amalgamates GPON, LTE, and Wi-Fi â€“ all under a single infrastructure.
As a technical manager in the Telekom Research and Development Centre, he is directly managing some 26 active members of technical staff.
Along the process his great achievements have received numerous accolades and awards, as follows:
* IEEE Professional Award (Macau) for a project on fixed mobile convergence (MWAN).
* Broadband World Forum Award (Netherlands) on Centralized-RAN based RoF (G-CORN) project.
* Corning Best Paper Award (California) for a project on fixed mobile convergence (MWAN).
* The RESEARCHER OF THE YEAR AWARD across the entire TM R&D.
* PAPER OF THE YEAR AWARD across the entire TM R&D

Prior to access networks, Thavamaran was heavily involved in a long-haul software program that defined optical systems during his postdoctoral period, which spanned up to a transmission rate of a couple of Tb/s, while his PhD research was purely in the area of LTE-RoF. Thavamaran has over 30 high impact publications, with a couple of patents filed in the area of RoF, and numerous international Awards (IEEE, Broadband Infovision).
